This Arduino project implements a timer for the Monday Night Shooting league.

The timer is a simple clock with LCD and keypad which allows for 2 Modes:

	1) simple timer
	2) program mode

1) Simple Timer allows the user to enter a time and the timer will count down
   from that time and signal a buzzer at the start and stop of the time.

2) program mode allows the user to select from a series of sequenced times.
   Each press of the start button will start the time for the next time in the
   sequence.  Either the expiration of the time or a stop signal will cause the
   timer to move to the next sequence.  The Timer displays the time countdown
   and the sequence string for each sequence.


The project is split into 3 main components.

	1) main hardware driving code (keypad processing, buttons, and LCD)
	2) simple timer logic
	3) program mode logic



Design/Implementation Details:

There are 2 state machines within the timer.

	1) the clock (timer)
	2) the mode state machine

Clock state machine:

	+---------+                         +---------+
	| STOPPED | --- "start (buzz)" ---> | RUNNING |
	+---------+                         +---------+
             ^                                |
	     |                                |
	     |                                |
	      \--- "start (buzz)" ------------/
               \                             /
	        \--- "stop button" ---------/
